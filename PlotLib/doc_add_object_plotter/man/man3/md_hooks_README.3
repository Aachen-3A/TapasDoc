md_hooks_README \- githookcontroller 
This repository contains the githookcontroller, a general tool to construct git hooks for gitHub based projects without a central contral server\&.
.PP
.SS "Using githookcontroller in your repo:"
.PP
.SS "Prerequisites"
.PP
The GitHookController needs git version > 1\&.8\&.2 installed\&. More information how to change the git version in the Aachen physics cluster can be found at the end of the readme\&. 
.SS "Setup:"
.PP
The easiest way to implement the githookcontroller to your repo is to add setup script as shown in the setup\&.sh\&.example file and run it from the root directory of your repo\&. 
.SS "Adjusting the hooks"
.PP
Githookcontroller ships with some exampe hook implementations, which you may want to adjust\&. The standard way to use the githookcontroller is to create a GitHookController class object within a python hook script, parse hook infos if necessary and call member functions of the controller (e\&.g\&. update doxygen) to perform hook actions as needed\&.

.SS "Currently implemented features:"

.IP "\(bu" 2
Parse output from pre-commit hooks\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2

.IP "\(bu" 2
Several easy to use controller class properties: current_branch, tracked remote_branches, local and remote root directory name, remote url\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Function to checkout different branches in local repo\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Create branch specific doxygen documentation on every commit (see hooks/pre-commit)\&. Doxygen documentation without warnig can be enfoced based on repo root and branch name\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2

.SS "Changing the git version in a linux cluster with cvmfs"
.PP
Newer versions of git can be used via cvmfs, e\&.g\&. by adding the bin folder to your PATH: export PATH=/cvmfs/cms\&.cern\&.ch/slc6_amd64_gcc481/external/git/1\&.8\&.3\&.1-cms/bin/:$PATH
